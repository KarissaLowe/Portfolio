Hello! I'm a dedicated Data Analyst with a knack for unraveling the stories hidden within many different types of data. My journey in the world of data began during my studies at Princeton University. There, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and fell in love with the statistics and visualizations I used for research. 

In my current role as a **Data Analyst at United Way of King County**, I have the privilege of using data to contribute to our community's welfare. Using a toolkit that includes SQL and R, I collect, clean, and analyze datasets to extract meaningful insights. I also craft interactive dashboards and visualizations using tools like Power BI, Plotly, and ggplot2. I work across many departments and empower decision-makers by presenting data in a way that's not just understandable, but actionable. 

My analytical journey extends to the realm of innovation as well. I've harnessed the power of Power Apps and Power Automate to create custom business solutions and streamline workflows. This has given me experience designing and creating database schemas that efficiently organize and store data. I even designed a company-wide expense reimbursement application that simplified a critical process.

Prior to my current position, I worked as a **Research Coordinator at the University of Washington's Institute for Risk Analysis.** Working on a USAID-funded project, I engaged with partners worldwide, analyzed complex data, and provided recommendations that shaped strategies.

I'm committed to fostering an inclusive environment. Leading diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at work allows me to combine my analytical mindset with a passion for positive change. I believe that data plays a big role in promoting equity and wellbeing for everyone in our community.
